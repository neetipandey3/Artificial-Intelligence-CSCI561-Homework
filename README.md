## Homework 1

*CSCI-561 - Fall 2017 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence* 

**Objective (Brief Summary)**

Place baby lizards in an N x N nursery. Any lizard can attack any other lizard to its top, bottom, left right or diagonal. The nursery has a few trees and the lizards cannot shoot their tongues through the trees 

To find the solution, use the following algorithms: 
- Breadth-first search (BFS) 
- Depth-first search (DFS) 
- Simulated annealing (SA)

**Python 3.4**


## Homework 2 - The Fruit Rage

*CSCI-561 - Fall 2017 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence* 

**Objective (Brief Summary)**

Implement a zero sum two player game in which each player tries to maximize his/her share from a batch of fruits randomly placed in a box. The box is divided into cells and each cell is either empty or filled with one fruit of a specific type. Once an agent picks the fruits from the cells, their empty place will be filled with other fruits on top of them (which fall down due to gravity), if any. Every agent has a limited amount of time to spend for thinking during the whole game. The overall score of each player is the sum of rewards gained for every turn. The game will terminate when there is no fruit left in the box or when a player has run out of time.

Implement 3 agents:
- Random agent: selects a random legal move on each turn.
- Minimax agent with no alpha-beta and lookahead depth limited to 3

**Python 3.4**



## Homework 3 - First Order Logic (FOL) Resolution

*CSCI-561 - Fall 2017 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence* 

**Objective (Brief Summary)**

Implemnet a highly optimized ineference engine. Create the Knowledge Base and use FOL Resolution for each input query
